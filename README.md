# python_sql_shell
An SQL shell that uses a trusted connection built in python.

I just needed an SQL box so I built one in python.

I'll make it pretty eventually and have it look like an actual shell but for now this is all it is.

Configuration:

Just add the server and database as strings. Enter "q!" to quit.
